# Project3-Wildfires

U.S. Wildfires 2023 Dashboard 

Purpose:

We seek to create a base model that can eventually be expanded upon that is able to visualize the distributions of wildfires and consolidate information relating to their root causes. This data could be utilized by governing agencies, first responders, and the general public to help identify if their location is at high risk of wildfires; by including the root causes it would provide an idea to these groups on what their risk factors are allowing for them to make better decisions on where to focus prevention efforts.

Our Process:

1. Data updates and CSV cleanup using Jupyter Notebook
2. More CSV cleanup, geojson creation and DB creation using SQL
3. Javascript file and visualization creation
4. Flask creation
5. Html integration
